      <li>- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until they're al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the diced
        onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent.</li>
      <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10 minutes,
        stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, and chopped parsley until well combined.</li>
      <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place
        three lasagna noodles on top. Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of the
        meat sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used,
        ending with a layer of meat sauce and cheese on top.</li>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake
        for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
